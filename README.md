## About AWS Pilot

AWS Pilot is crafted especially for ***lazy developers***, it was a personal project at first to manage my own startup but later I realized I should push it for the public.
By ***lazy developers***, I meant *Senior Software Developers*, who knows project lifecycle inside out but sometimes feel too lazy to reach out to terminal and do stuff the old way (*vim*, *nano* and *bash*). 

## Real life utility
For example, if you are working with a startup, you might be a single developer (or more), owning a bigger part of the software and rapidly developing a testing a lot of features. It sometime really becomes hectic to switch between your IDE and CLI even though cli is right in the editor (maybe it's only me), you have to commit, push (local), deploy, restart web server run migrations (remote) etc. 

## Features
AWS Pilot is bring a little bit ease to your software development workflow and make your life easier by giving you one stop UI to manage everything, 
* Don't login to your server 
* Do everything from your local (***server***)
* Read & Edit any file from your server with a nice Editor (***server***)
* Run commands on your server from the UI (***server***)
* Commit all your projects (***git***)
* switch between production mode, staging mode or test mode (***git***)
* and live your life happily
